# curriculum
This is my curriculum, in particular, all the projects I've done. This part is finalized represent my competencies in every exam I've work.

I am Matteo Liberti, a student of the first year of Magistrale at university "La Sapienza". 
During my first semester, I've done one or more projects in software security, computer vision.
I submit these projects and their description.
