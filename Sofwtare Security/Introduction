In this file I explain my projects of Software Security.
The aim of this exam is provided the basis of SECURITY and SAFE of systems. In particular these projects are assigned to using

Naturally, at the end of this course I did the final write test on others argouments (obfuscation, rule java programming, 
definition of non-termination, Security in the process of Software Development Life Cycle, ... ).
