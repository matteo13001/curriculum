In this file I explain my projects of Software Security.
The aim of this exam is provided the basis of SECURITY and SAFE of systems. In particular these projects are assigned to using
the (static and dinamic) tools. With our knowledges and tools we found the bugs/vulnerabilities of C/Java/php/html system.
Naturally, at the end of this course I did the final write test on others argouments (obfuscation, rule java programming, 
definition of non-termination, Security in the process of Software Development Life Cycle, ... ).
Short description of the two individual projects and one group project

  - In the first individual project the aim is find the bugs in the files using tools and human static analysis. 
    The programming language used is C
  - In the second individual project the aim is tha same of the first individual project but, the language used is Java. 
  - In the group project the aim is the same of the individual project but, this time, there are no files but the real system with 
    true requisites, ... . 
During this work I've understood the tools are important but the programmer, designer, ... must review the codes and the limits of tools.
