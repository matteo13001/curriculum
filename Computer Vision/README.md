I show you my group project in computer vision.
I use "We" because the project is a group. 
We designed the Web application that works in this mode: it shows ten images in different moments,
for each image it catches the facial expression and it decides what emotion aroused the image in him with the relative hashtag.
the aim is to evaluate emotion based on the image, i.e., if there is an image on the sea, the person can be happy (then #happy) 
or sad (then #traumatized), for example.
